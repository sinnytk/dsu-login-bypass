## How does it work?

When I was building the [DSU Feedback Bot](https://github.com/sinnytk/dsu-feedback-bot), I stumbled upon this [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47199727/how-can-i-handle-the-login-alert)

Basically, you can bypass the login prompt by using

[http://username:password@lms.dsu.edu.pk](http://username:password@lms.dsu.edu.pk)

As compared to,

[http://lms.dsu.edu.pk](http://lms.dsu.edu.pk)

This extension basically emulates that by saving your username, password in Google Chrome Sync storage and redirecting you to authorized URL every time it finds __lms.dsu.edu.pk__ in the Web Request
